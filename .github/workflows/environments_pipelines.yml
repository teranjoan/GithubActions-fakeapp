  # === WORKFLOW TRIGGERS ===
  
  # In GitHub Actions, workflow_call is a trigger that allows one workflow to be called from another workflow. This is useful for creating reusable workflows, enabling modular CI/CD pipelines.

  # Key concepts:

  # Reusable workflows: You define a workflow that can be invoked by other workflows using workflow_call.
  # Inputs and secrets: You can specify inputs and secrets that the calling workflow passes to the called workflow.
  # Usage: The calling workflow uses the uses: keyword to reference the reusable workflow.
  # Example definition:

  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      caller_environment:
        description: 'Environment from calling workflow'
        required: false
        type: string
        default: 'unknown'
    
    secrets:
      deployment_token:
        required: false
